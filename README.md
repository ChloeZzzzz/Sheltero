# Sheltero
Job finding App designed for everyone. Visit the website at shelteroinf.herokuapp.com. The app can be run under the folder **Project/project_app and found** at : https://github.com/SaintTan/Sheltero

## Features
**Sign up**
We have implemented a sign up function which would allow candidates to sign up onto our website; the data is currently stored in the models folder, and is therefore not connected to a cloud database. However, the user is still allowed to signup. Candidates could pick whether they are an employee or employer. 

To access the signup function, simply click on the url link below, or visit the homepage and click on the *signup button*

**Sign in**
The sign in feature has also been implemented and the identification of individuals is dealt with passport.js. It looks for the individual in the models folder and check to see if they are an existing user, and have the correct password.

To access the signin function, simply click on the url link below, or visit the homepage and click on the *signin button*

**Job Searching**
A field for users to search for jobs is implemented to allow users to search for jobs. It displays the title, salary, details of the job, company who posted the job as well as their contact details. Users could search jobs any of values. This feature can also be access right after the user login.

To access the job searching function, simply click on the url link below, or just visit the homepage. Additionally you can access the function after signing in (and sign up if you havent done so).
